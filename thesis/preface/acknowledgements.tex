\chapter*{\centering Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank Alastair Reid, formerly employed at Arm Ltd., now working for Google Research, for all the time and help he put into this thesis.
I was very lucky to be able to continue the work he and I did during my internship at Arm.
I am very grateful that even after my internship at Arm ended, he put his free time into my work such that I was able to write a thesis in the field of formal verification.
Without his guidance, I would not have been able to write, not even start this thesis.

Secondly, I want to thank Jörn Hoffmann of the department of Technische Informatik who agreed to supervise me at the University of Leipzig.
Without having known me or having a direct affiliation to the topic of my thesis, he allowed me to officially write this thesis and gave guidance whenever I wasn't sure about the direction of my thesis.

Also I want to thank Prof. Dr. Andreas Maletti of the department of Algebraische und logische Grundlagen der Informatik.
When I was working on my thesis but was not yet supervised by someone at my university, he helped me to keep motivated whenever I felt lost because of the physical distance to my unofficial supervisor.

And last but not least, I want to thank my proofreaders and friends Friedrich Schöne and Nico Duldhardt who not only read my thesis but also contributed towards it by friendship and exchange.
