\section{Introduction}

In \cite{Ferraiuolo17} the authors present an approach to formally verifying the ARM TrustZone architecture by using static information flow analysis.
They apply the method of information flow control (IFC) to the hardware description language (HDL) implementing said architecture.
They introduce a lattice of security labels and a way of annotating HDL code with said labels.
Intuitively, it is allowed for information to flow "up" the lattice but not "down".
Furthermore, there are type-system rules that propagate labelings throughout the HDL code and type-check this code with regard to the security labelings.

The goal of this project is to apply this approach of using security labelings to model information flow to the process of model checking an architectural model of a microprocessor with multiple privilege levels.
The model checker will quantify over programs running on the microprocessor and check properties like: "It is not possible for secure information stored at point Y to leak".
We expect to find programs that will violate such properties simply because privileged code can do \textit{anything} that is also leaking information.

This approach must not be seen as an attempt to formally verify the security of an architecture itself.
It is an attempt to program patterns that can leak information and finding rules that - when complied with - guarantee the absence of such leaks.
We will however also have in mind that a IFC formalism might not be able to find \textit{all} issues that can arise during the programming of microcontrollers.
Therefore another goal of this project is to explore the power of a labeled-IFC approach.

\section{Project Plan}

The project divides itself into the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Development of a simplified architectural model which should include
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Protected system control registers
        \item General purpose registers
        \item A model of memory with secure and non-secure regions
        \item At least 8 instructions: load immediate, load, store, add, subtract, compare, branch, enter privileged mode, leave privileged mode
    \end{itemize}
    \item Formal implementation of the architectural model in SMT
    \item Verification
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Verification can be done straight-forward but it might be advisable to use algorithms like SPACER to enhance performance and output
    \end{itemize}
    \item Iteration \& refinement
    \item Evaluation
\end{enumerate}
